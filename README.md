# odin_recipes

This is a simple static website created as part of The Odin Project's Foundations course. This project demonstrates fundamental HTML webpage structure.
This project is about creating a recipe website, comprising a collection of webpage where each page details a unique recipe. The website has a homepage and some recipe webpages. The hompages only includes the heading and hyperlinks all individual recipe pages. Each recipe page includes a description, picture of the recipe, ingridients and steps to make the recipe. All the webpages are interconnected via hyperlinks. The webpages are simple and purely built with just HTML, demonstrating fundamental webpage structuring without any styling or scripting.

Upon completion of this project, and the HTML foundation lessons, I will have demonstrated the abilty to,

- Structure a basic webpage
- Implement texts and semantics
- Embed images and alternative texts
- Create a table
- Effectively utilize a wide range of tags and attributes
