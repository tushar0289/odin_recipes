    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Lasagna is a quintessential Italian baked pasta dish, celebrated for its delicious layers. It typically features wide, flat pasta sheets interleaved with a hearty meat sauce, often a slow-simmered Bolognese, and creamy cheese fillings, most commonly a blend of ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan. <br>
        The magic of lasagna lies in its construction, with each component contributing to a rich and satisfying experience. Once assembled, it's baked until the cheeses are melted and bubbling, and the flavors have beautifully melded together, resulting in a comforting and deeply flavorful meal.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    A classic lasagna typically includes these main ingredients,
    <ul>
        <li>2 Olive Oil plus extra for the dish</li>
        <li>750g Lean Beef Mince</li>
        <li>90g Pack Prosciutto</li>
        <li>800g Passata or half our basic Tomato Sauce</li>
        <li>200ml Hot Beef Stock</li>
        <li>Nutmeg</li>
        <li>300g Fresh Lasagne Sheets</li>
        <li>White Sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    Making lasagna, while seemingly complex, can be broken down into a few manageable steps,

    <ol>
        <li>To make the meat sauce, heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a frying pan and cook 750g lean beef mince in two batches for about 10 mins until browned all over.</li>
        <li>Finely chop 4 slices of prosciutto from a 90g pack, then stir through the meat mixture.</li>
        <li>Pour over 800g passata or half our basic tomato sauce recipe and 200ml hot beef stock. Add a little grated nutmeg, then season.</li>
        <li>Bring up to the boil, then simmer for 30 mins until the sauce looks rich.</li>
        <li>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and lightly oil an ovenproof dish (about 30 x 20cm).</li>
        <li>Spoon one third of the meat sauce into the dish, then cover with some fresh lasagne sheets from a 300g pack. Drizzle over roughly 130g ready-made or homemade white sauce.</li>
        <li>Repeat until you have three layers of pasta. Cover with the remaining 390g white sauce, making sure you canâ€™t see any pasta poking through.</li>
        <li>Scatter 125g torn mozzarella over the top.</li>
        <li>Arrange the rest of the prosciutto on top. Bake for 45 mins until the top is bubbling and lightly browned.</li>
    </ol>
