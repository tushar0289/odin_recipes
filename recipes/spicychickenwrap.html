    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A spicy chicken and avocado wrap is a vibrant and flavorful meal, perfect for a quick lunch or light dinner. It typically features tender, cooked chicken that has been tossed in a zesty, spicy sauce â€“ this could be anything from a hot sauce like Frank's RedHot, to a homemade blend with chili powder, paprika, and garlic.<br>
        This fiery chicken is then balanced by the creamy, cooling contrast of sliced or mashed avocado, all nestled within a soft tortilla or wrap. Often, fresh elements like crisp lettuce, a hint of lime juice, or cilantro are added, making for a refreshing yet satisfying bite that delivers a kick of heat with every delicious mouthful.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        Here are the steps to make a Spicy Chicken and Avocado Wrap,
        <ol>
            <li>Mix the chicken with the lime juice, chilli powder and garlic.</li>
            <li>Heat the oil in a non-stick frying pan then fry the chicken for a couple of mins, it will cook very quickly so keep an eye on it. Meanwhile, warm the wraps following the pack instructions or, if you have a gas hob, heat them over the flame to slightly char them. Do not let them dry out or they are difficult to roll.</li>
            <li>Squash half an avocado onto each wrap, add the peppers to the pan to warm them through then pile onto the wraps with the chicken, and sprinkle over the coriander. Roll up, cut in half and eat with your fingers.</li>
        </ol>
